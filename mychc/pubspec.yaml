  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/mychc_no_bg.png
    - assets/images/mychc.png
    - assets/images/chc1.jpeg
    - assets/images/chc2.jpg
    - assets/images/chc3.jpg
    - assets/images/chc4.jpg
    - assets/audios/1.mp3
    - assets/audios/2.mp3

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/montserrat.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins.ttf
    - family: Inspiration
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/inspiration.ttf

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
